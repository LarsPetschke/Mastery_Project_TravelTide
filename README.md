This project aims to analyze the data of TravelTide to identify new customer clusters for a Rewards Program.

The project is structured as follows:

Afterwards, a first rule set based evaluation of the customers is made to identify potential clusters
Finally, a machine learning algorithm for clustering is implemented and evaluated
Clusters are further analyzed and structured based on features
